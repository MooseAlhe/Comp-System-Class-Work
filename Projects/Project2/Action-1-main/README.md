# Action-1

This code sets up 4 teams that are threads and each thread is in charge of 3 specififed signals. You can change which signals you want to find by simply
changing the parameters of the pthread_kill() function. Put in any signal out of the 8 and the thread that is responsible for it, and it should output the
creation of each thread and then output the signals caught.
